HEAPS

- A binary heap must be a complete tree.

- Children are added at each level from left to right.

- Usually implemented as arrays.

- The maximum or minimum value will always be at the root
  of the tree - the advantage of using a heap.

- Heapify: process of converting a binary tree into a heap -
  this often has to be done after an insertion or deletion.

- No required ordering between siblings.
