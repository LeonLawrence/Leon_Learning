Stacks

- Abstract data Type.
- LIFO - Last in, first out.

- push - adds an item as the top item on the stack.
- pop - removes the top item on the stack.
- peek - gets the top item on the stack without popping it.
- ideal backing data structure: linked list.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Time Complexity:
- O(1) for push, pop and peek, when using a linked list.

- if you use an array, then push is O(N), because the
  array may have to be resized.

- If you know the maximum number of items that will
  ever be on the stack, an array can be a good choice.

- If memory is tight, an array might be a good choice.

- Linked list is ideal.
