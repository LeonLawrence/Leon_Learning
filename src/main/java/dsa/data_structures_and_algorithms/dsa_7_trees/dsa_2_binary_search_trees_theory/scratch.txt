BINARY TREES

- Every node has 0, 1, or 2 children.
- Children are referred to as left child and right child.
- In practice, we use binary search trees.

BINARY SEARCH TREE (BST)

- Can perform insertions, deletions, and retrievals in O(logn) time.

- The left child always has a smaller value than its parent.

- The right child always has a larger value than its parent.

- This means everything to the left of the root is less than the
  value of the root, and everything to the right of the root is
  greater than the value of the root.

- Because of that, we can do a binary search.
