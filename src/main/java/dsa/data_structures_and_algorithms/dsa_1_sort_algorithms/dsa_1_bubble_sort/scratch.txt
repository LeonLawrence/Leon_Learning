Bubble sort

- In-place algorithm.

- O(n2) time complexity - quadratic.

- It will take 100 steps to sort 10 items, 10,000 steps to sort 100 items,
  1,000,000 steps to sort 1000 items.

- Algorithm degrades quickly

- Stable sort algorithm


Bubble sort = pairs of adjacent elements are compared, and the elements
              swapped if they are not in order.

              small data set = okay-ish
              large data set = bad
