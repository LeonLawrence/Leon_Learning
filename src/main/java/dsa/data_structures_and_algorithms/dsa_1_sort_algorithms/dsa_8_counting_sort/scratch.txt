Counting Sort

- Makes assumptions about the data.
- Doesn't use comparisons.
- Counts the number of occurrences of each value.
- Only works with non-negative discrete values
  (can't work with floats, strings)
- Values must be within a specific range.

- NOT an in-place algorithm.

- O(n) - can achieve this because we're making
  assumptions about the data we're sorting.

- If we want the sort to be stable, we have to do some
  extra steps
