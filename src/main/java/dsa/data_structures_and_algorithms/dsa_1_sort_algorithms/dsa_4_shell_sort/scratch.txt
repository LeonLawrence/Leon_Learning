- Shell Sort

- Variation of Insertion Sort

- Insertion sort chooses which element to insert using a gap of 1.

- Shell sort starts out using a larger gap value.

- As the algorithm runs, the gap is reduced

- Goal is to reduce the amount of shifting required.

-------------------------------------------------------------

- As the algorithm progresses, the gap is reduced.

- The gap value of 1 is equivalent to insertion sort

- So, the algorithm does some preliminary work (using
  gap values greater than 1), and then becomes
  insertion sort.

- By the time we get to insertion sort, the array has been
  partially sorted, so there's less shifting rquired

-------------------------------------------------------------

Shell Sort
- In-place algorithm

- Difficult to nail down the time complexity because it
  will depend on the gap. Worst Case: O(n2), but it can
  perform much better than that

- Doesn't require as much shifting as insertion sort, so it
  usually performs better.

- Unstable algorithm.
