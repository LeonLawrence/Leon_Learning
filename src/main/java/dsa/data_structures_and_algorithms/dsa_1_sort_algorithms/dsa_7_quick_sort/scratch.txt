Quick Sort

- Divide and conquer algorithm.
- Recursive algorithm.
- Uses a pivot element to partition the array into two parts.
- Elements < pivot to its left, elements > pivot to its right.
- Pivot will then be in its correct sorted position.


- Process is now repeated for the left array and right array.
- Eventually, every element has been the pivot, so every element
  will be in its correct sorted position.
- As with merge sort, we'll end up partitioning the array
  into a series of 1-element arrays.
- Does this in-place (unlike merge sort)


- In-place algorithm.
- O(nlogn) - base 2. We're repeatedly partitioning the array into two halves.
- Unstable algorithm.
