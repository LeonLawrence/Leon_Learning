What are Operators?

Operators in Java are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands,
and then return a result. As an example, we used the + (addition) operator
to sum the value of two variables.



What is an Operand?

An operand is a term used to describe any object that is manipulated by an operator.
If we consider this statement.

int myVar = 15 + 12;

Then + is the operator, and 15 and 12 are the operands. Variables used instead of literals
are also operands.

double mySalary = hoursWorked * hourlyRate

In the above line hoursWorked and hourlyRate are operands, and * (multiplication) is the
operator.



What is an Expression?

In the statement below,

hoursWorked * hourlyRate is the expression.

If hoursWorked was 10.00 and hourlyRate was 20.00 then the expression would return 200.00;

double mySalary = hoursWorked * hourlyRate;

Lets explore Operators in more detail.
