What are variables?

Variables are a way to store information in our computer. Variables that we define in a
program can be accessed by a name we give them, and the computer does the hard work
of figuring out where they get stored in the computers random access memory (RAM).

A variable, as the name suggests can be changed, in other words, it's contents are variable.
What we have to do is tell the computer what type of information we want to store in the
variable, and then give it a name.

There are lots of different types of data we can define for our variables. Collectively these
are known as Data types. As you may have guessed, data types are keywords in Java.

Let's start out by defining a variable of type int - int being an abbreviation for integer, a
whole number (that is a number without any decimal points).

To define a variable we need to specify the data type, then give our variable a name, and
optionally add an expression to initialize the variable with a value.
