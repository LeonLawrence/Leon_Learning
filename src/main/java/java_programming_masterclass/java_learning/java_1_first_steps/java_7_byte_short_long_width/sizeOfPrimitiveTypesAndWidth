Size of Primitive Types and Width

A Byte occupies 8 bits. A bit is not directly represented in a primitive type - We have a
boolean which is not really the same thing. So a Byte occupies 8 bits. We say that a byte
has a width of 8.

A short can store a large range of numbers and occupies 16 bits, and has a width of 16.

An int, has a much larger range as we know, and occupies 32 bits, and has a width of 32.

The point here is that each primitive type occupies a different amount of memory - we can
see that an int needs four times the amount of space, than a byte does for example.

It's not particularly relevant for you to know these numbers, but it could come up
as an interview question and it is useful to know that certain data types take up
more space than others.
