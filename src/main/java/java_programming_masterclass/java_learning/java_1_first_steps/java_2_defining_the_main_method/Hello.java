/*
 What is a method?
 It's a collection of statements (one or more) that performs an operation.
 We'll be using a special method called the main method that Java looks
 for when running a program. It's the entry point of any Java code.

public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*

        public: This is an access modifier.

        static: This is a Java keyword that needs an understanding of other concepts,
        for now, know that we need to have static for java to find our method
        to run the code we are going to add.

        The static keyword in Java is mainly used for memory management. The static keyword in
        Java is used to share the same variable or method of a given class. The users can apply
        static keywords with variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes. The static keyword
        belongs to the class than an instance of the class

        void: This is a Java keyword used to indicate that the method will not return
        anything.

        parenthesis: The left and right parenthesis in a method declaration are
        mandatory and can optionally include one or more parameters - which is a
        way to pass information to a method.

        code block: A code block is used to define a block of code. It's mandatory
        to have one in a method declaration, and it's here where we will be adding
        statements to perform certain tasks.

        statement: This is a complete command to be executed and can include one or
        more expressions.
