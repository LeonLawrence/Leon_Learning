if-then Statements in Java

The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It tells your
program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true.

This is known as conditional logic.

Conditional logic uses specific statements in Java to allow us to check a condition and
execute certain code based on whether that condition (the expression is true or false.)
