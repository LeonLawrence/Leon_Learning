Overflow and Underflow in Java

If you try and put a value larger than the maximum value in java, or a value smaller than
the minimum value in Java, then you will get an Overflow in the case of the maximum value
or an Underflow in the case of the minimum.

The computer just skips back to the minimum number or the maximum number, which is
usually not what you want. It's an important concept to be aware of.
