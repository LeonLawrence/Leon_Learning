BINARY SEARCH

- Data must be sorted!

- Chooses the element in the middle of the array and
  compares it against the search value.

- If element is equal to the value, we're done.

- If element is greater than the value, search the left half of the array.

- If the element is less than the value, search the right half of the array.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

- At some point, there will be only one element in the partition you're
  checking, but it doesn't have to get to that point.

- Can be implemented recursively.

- O(logn) - keeps dividing the array in half.
