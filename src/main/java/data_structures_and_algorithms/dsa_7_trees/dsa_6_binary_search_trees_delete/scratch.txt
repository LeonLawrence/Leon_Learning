Delete node with two children

- Need to figure out what the replacement node will be.
- Want minimal disruption to the existing tree structure.
- Can take the replacement node from the deleted node's left subtree.
- If taking it from the left subtree, we have to take the largest value in the left subtree.
- If taking it from the right subtree, we have to take the smallest value in the right subtree.
- Choose one and stick to it.
