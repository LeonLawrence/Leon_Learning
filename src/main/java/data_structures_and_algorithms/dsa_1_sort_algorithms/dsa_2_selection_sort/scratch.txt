Selection sort

- In-place algorithm.

- O(n2) time complexity - quadratic.

- It will take 100 steps to sort 10 items, 10,000 steps to sort 100 items
  1,000,000 steps to sort 1000 items.

- Doesn't require as much swapping as bubble sort.

- Unstable algorithm.

Selection sort = search through an array and keep track of the minimum value
                 during each iteration. At the end of each iteration, we swap variables.

                 small data set = okay
                 large data set = bad
