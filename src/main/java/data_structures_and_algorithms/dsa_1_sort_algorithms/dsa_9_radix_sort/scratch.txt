Radix Sort

- Makes assumptions about the data.
- Data must have same radix and width.
- Because of this, data must be integers or strings.
- Sort based on each individual digit or letter position.
- Start at the rightmost position.
- Must use a stable sort algorithm at each stage.


- Counting sort is often used as the sort algorithm for radix sort
  (must be stable counting sort)

- O(n) - can achieve this because we're making assumptions
  about the data we're sorting.

- Even so, it often runs slower than O(nlogn) algorithms, because
  of the overhead involved.

- In-place depends on which sort algorithm you use.

- Stable algorithm.
