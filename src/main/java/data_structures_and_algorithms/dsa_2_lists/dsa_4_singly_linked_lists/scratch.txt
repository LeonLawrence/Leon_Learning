- A LinkedList is data structure for a group of objects, but
  arraylist is not involved.

- Each item in the list is called a node.
- The first item in the list is not head of the list.

1) Create a new node "Bill"
2) Assign "Jane" to the next field
3) Assign head to "Bill"
4) Will be O(1) time complexity


- A Singly linked list is best used for adding or removing on the
  front of a list.
