Heaps - Delete

- Must choose a replacement value.
- Will take the rightmost value, so that the tree remains complete.
- Then we must heapify the heap.
- When replacement value is greater than parent, fix heap above. Otherwise, fix heap below.

- Fix heap above - same as insert. Swap replacement value with parent.
- Fix heap below - swap the replacement value with the larger of its two children.
- Rinse and repeat in both cases until the replacement value is in its correct position.
- Will only need to fix up or down, not both.
