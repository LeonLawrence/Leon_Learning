Heaps as Arrays

- We can store binary heaps as arrays.
- We put the root at array[0].
- We then traverse each level from left to right,
  and so the left child of the root would go into
  array[1], it's right child would to into array[2],
  ect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insert into Heap

- Always add new items to the end of the array.
- Then we have to fix the heap (heapify).
- We compare the new item against its parent.
- If the item is greater than its parent, we swap it with its parent.
- We then rinse and repeat.
